    > 'Inspect element'
    > Ctrl+F
    > try to find elements using following selectors

Selectors:
    universal       *                       all elements
    tag             <value>                 elements with <value> tag name (input, div, span ...)
    attribute       [<attr>="value"]        full match of specified attribute value
        id          #<value>
        class       .<value>                entry of value to specified attribute full value

Combining selectors:
    ''              AB                      element has simultaneously A and B selectors
    ','             A , B                   element match A, B or both
    ' '             A   B                   B elements inside A
    '>'             A > B                   B is direct child of A
    '~'             A ~ B                   all siblings of A, which follow after A
    '~'             A + B                   B only if it immediately follows A
    '||'            A || B                  all B, which are of the same column as A
